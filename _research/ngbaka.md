name: Ngbaka co-occurrence restrictions
---

Starting with my dissertation research and continuing to the other works listed below, I parsed and analyzed a Ngbaka Minagende dictionary to look for co-occurrence restrictions among consonants. 

The csv wordlist as used in the work below and the full dictionary as an SQLite database are available on github. Each has a corresponding Jupyter notebook with details. Running these notebooks requires an install of both python and jupyter (or Anaconda), or you can download the raw files directly and parse them using tools of your own.
