My focus is in theoretical phonology. Empirical domains include African languages and linguistics, processes involving place of articulation, and segmental processes in general. Driving themes include the balance between representation and computation, the structure of linguistic typologies, and the formal modeling of both.

I am currently a Lecturer in linguistics at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://linguistics.wustl.edu/). See my [teaching]({% link teaching.md %}) page for my current office hours and course info. My office on campus is January 206.
