I am a Senior Lecturer in linguistics at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://linguistics.wustl.edu/). See my [teaching](teaching.qmd) page for my current office hours and course info. My office on campus is January 206.

My focus is in theoretical and computational phonology. Empirical domains include local and long-distance assimilation processes, especially those involving complex segments, and segmental processes in general. Theoretically I am interested in the representation of segments, and how such representations differ in both a logical sense (in terms of computational power) and in the specific linguistic properties encoded. Read more about my [research](research.qmd).
