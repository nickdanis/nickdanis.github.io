The size of the matrix will correspond to the number of features in the feature matrix. In the top element of the feature matrix, type “-son”. You will notice that it appears in a slightly italic looking style, with awkward spacing. This is because by default Word expects parts of an equation, not words. Select what you just typed, and click “Text” at the top. This tells Word that this part of the equation is plain text.
