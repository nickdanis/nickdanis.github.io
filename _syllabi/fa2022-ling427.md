## Description

"This course introduces the advanced linguistics or computer science student to the fields of learnability and computation as they apply to the study of linguistic theories and natural language. Topics covered include the formal language hierarchy, including the subregular languages; issues in the learnability of phonology, morphology, and syntax; and algorithms specific to constraint-based linguistic grammars. Prerequisites: either CS 131 or Ling 317 and at least one of the following: Ling 309, Ling 311, Ling 313, or Ling 315."

## Goals

* Explore the relationship between natural language and the formal language hierarchy
* Critically examine the comparison of theories from a computational point of view
* Implement and understand various algorithms defined for linguistic theories in a hands-on way

## Required Materials

All readings are posted as PDFs on [Canvas]({{ page.canvas-url }}). Occasionally, the use of software on the students' own computers is necessary, but this software is free and cross-platform. More details will be given in class.

## Grade

Your grade breakdown is shown below.

| Item                        | pct |
| :-------------------------- | --- |
| Assignments                 | 20% |
| Participation & Discussions | 30% |
| Papers                      | 50% |

### Assignments

There will be occasional short problem sets on the logic and formalisms discussed in class. Depending on your background, these might be review or they might be new. The purpose of these assignments is to make sure everyone is on the same page.

### Participation and Discussions

There will be multiple student-led discussion days throughout the semester. Your discussion group will have to prepare a handout to guide the rest of the class through that day's reading. Further details are on Canvas.

### Papers

There is both a midterm squib (~5 pages) and a final paper (10 pages). Both involve application of course concepts to natural language data, with the freedom to incorporate any expertise you may have. 

As part of the final paper, there will also be a proposal stage and a presentation during the last weeks of class. You should start thinking about topics now, and feel free to reach out with any ideas or questions.

### Letter grades

Letter grades are assigned based off the following scale. Numerical grades are **not** rounded.

If you are taking this class pass/fail, you must receive at least a C- (70%) to pass. 

If you believe there has been an error in grading, I am happy to discuss it with you. However, you must bring it up to me within one week of the graded assignment being returned to you. After this, the grade is considered final. 

## Schedule

The exact schedule is likely to change as the semester progresses. Please see [Canvas]({{ page.canvas-url }}) for all up-to-date readings and assignment due dates.
