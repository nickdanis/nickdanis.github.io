## Description

"There are several important abilities involved in the use of human language, one of these being the ability to organize speech sounds. The system that the brain uses to accomplish this task is the subject matter of phonology. This course will explore phonology from several perspectives within generative linguistics, including both traditional rule-based and current Optimality Theoretic approaches. Topics to be discussed include phonological features, lexical phonology, prosodic morphology, tone, and metrical stress. Assignments will help students learn to analyze phonological problems in a variety of languages and to evaluate the consequences of using different analytic approaches. Prerequisite: Ling 170D or permission of instructor."

## Goals

* Understand fundamentals of phonological theory
* Identiy and model basic phonological alternations
* Create generative segmental and prosodic representations

## Required Materials

The primary textbook for this course is listed below. Any additional readings will be posted as PDFs.

* Hayes, Bruce. 2011. [*Introductory Phonology*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introductory+Phonology-p-9781444360134), Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN: 978-1-444-36013-4.

## Grade

Your grade breakdown is shown below.

| Item                       | pct |
| :------------------------- | --- |
| Assignments                | 60% |
| Participation & group work | 20% |
| Final                      | 20% |

Assignments are assigned (roughly) weekly. The lowest grade is dropped. 

### Letter grades

Letter grades are assigned based off the following scale. Numerical grades are **not** rounded. 

{% include letter-grades.html %}

If you are taking this class pass/fail, you must receive at least a C- (70%) to pass. 

If you believe there has been an error in grading, I am happy to discuss it with you. However, you must bring it up to me within one week of the graded assignment being returned to you. After this, the grade is considered final. 

### Lateness

Unexcused late work incurs a penalty of 0.5% deducted for every hour late (as calculated by the Canvas overlords). This (roughly) translates to one letter grade (and change) each day. *Excused* late work is a different matter; please contact me as soon as you suspect circumstances will prevent you from completing work on time. 

## Schedule

Below is a rough schedule of the course material, and is likely to change. Please see [Canvas]({{ page.canvas-url }}) for all up-to-date readings and assignment due dates.
