## Description

This seminar is an in-depth exploration of linguistic analyses in the Optimality Theory (OT) framework. OT is a constraint-based system where linguistic structure (be it from phonology, morphology, or syntax) is evaluated in parallel to determine the "best" candidate for a particular language. Students will engage in the primary literature on OT, dissect published analyses, and conduct formal OT analyses of their own. The seminar serves both to survey OT as well as to develop mastery in formal analysis and linguistic argumentation in general. No prior knowledge of OT is necessary. Prequisite: Ling 313.

## Grade

The grade for this class is evenly divided between three categories: attendance/participation, technical practice, and the final project. As this is a small seminar, constant participation and attendance is mandatory. Technical practice refers small, low-stakes exercises that make sure the fundamentals of theory are understood. The final project is a research paper that you work on throughout the semester, culminating in 10-15 pages (single spaced) of analysis and research. More detail is given in class.

### Letter grades

Letter grades are assigned based off the following scale. Numerical grades are **not** rounded. 

{% include letter-grades.html %}

If you are taking this class pass/fail, you must receive at least a C- (70%) to pass. 

If you believe there has been an error in grading, I am happy to discuss it with you. However, you must bring it up to me within one week of the graded assignment being returned to you. After this, the grade is considered final.
