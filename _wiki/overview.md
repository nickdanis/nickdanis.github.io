title: Optimality Theory overview
---

Optimality Theory is a constraint-based, parallel grammatical framework. This contrasts with the rule-based serialism of SPE and Hayes. The architecture of OT consists of three primary components: GEN, CON, and EVAL.

## GEN

GEN takes a given [input]({% link _wiki/candidates.md %}#input) and **generates** a set of possible output forms. Each input/output pair, along with the correspondence relation between them, is a [candidate]({% link _wiki/candidates.md %}).

GEN is a function and it must be defined explicitly. GEN can be thought of as applying any number of possible phonological operations to an input form: adding segments, removing segments, changing segments, and so on. 

## CON

## EVAL
