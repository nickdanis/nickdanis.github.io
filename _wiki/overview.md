title: Optimality Theory overview
---

Optimality Theory is a constraint-based, parallel grammatical framework. This contrasts with the rule-based serialism of SPE and Hayes. The architecture of OT consists of three primary components: GEN, CON, and EVAL.

### GEN

GEN takes a given [input]({% link candidates.md %}) and **generates** a set of possible output forms. 

### CON

### EVAL
